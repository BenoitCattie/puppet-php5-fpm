; Start a new pool named 'www'
; The name is used in logs and stats
; There is no limitation of the number of pool FPM can handle. Your system will tell you anyway :)
[www]

; Address to accept fastcgi requests on.
; Valid syntaxes are:
; - 'ip.ad.re.ss:port' to listen on a TCP scoket to the specific address on the specific port
; - 'port' to listen on a TCP socket to all addreses on the specific port
; - '/path/to/unix/socket' to listen on a unix socket
; it's mandatory
;
;listen = /var/run/php5-fpm.sock
listen = 127.0.0.1:9000

; Set listen(2) backlog
; -1 means unlimited
; default : -1
;
;listen.backlog = -1
 
; List of ipv4 addresses of FastCGI clients that allowed to connect.
; Equivalent to FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS environment in original php.fcgi (5.2.2+)
; Makes sense only with a tcp listening socket.
; Each addresses must be separated by a comma
; default: any
;
;listen.allowed_clients = 127.0.0.1

; Set permissions for unix socket, if one used.
; In Linux read/write permissions must be set in order to allow connections from web server.
; Many BSD-derrived systems allow connections regardless of permissions. 
; default: user and group are set as the running user. Mode is set to 0666
;
;listen.owner = www-data
;listen.group = www-data
;listen.mode = 0666

; Unix user/group of processes
; The user is mandatory. If the group is not set, the default user's group
; will be used
user = www-data
group = www-data

; Choose the process manager which control how processes are managed
; Two choices:
; - static  : a fixed number (pm.max_children) of child processes
; - dynamic : The number of child processes are set up dynamically depending on the following directives
;             - pm.max_children      : the maximum number of children that can be alive at the same time
;             - pm.start_servers     : the number of children created on startup
;             - pm.min_spare_servers : the minimum number of children in 'idle' state (waiting to precess).
;                                      If the number of 'idle' processes is less than this number,
;                                      some children will be created.
;             - pm.max_spare_servers : the maximum number of children in 'idle' state (waiting to precess).
;                                      If the number of 'idle' processes is greater than this number,
;                                      some children will be killed;
; It's mandatory
;pm = dynamic
pm = static

; Sets the limit on the number of simultaneous requests (children processes will be forked) that will be served.
; Equivalent to Apache MaxClients directive (with mpm_prefork).
; Equivalent to PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN environment in original php.fcgi
; Used with any pm.style.
; It's mandatory
;
pm.max_children = 10

; Sets the number of server processes created on startup.
; Used only with 'dynamic' pm.style
; default : min_spare + (max_spare - min_spare) / 2
;
;pm.start_servers = 20

; Sets the desired minimum number of idle server processes.
; Used only with 'dynamic' pm.style
; It's mandatory when pm is set to dynamic
;
;pm.min_spare_servers = 5

; Sets the desired maximum number of idle server processes.
; Used only with 'dynamic' pm.style
; It's mandatory when pm is set to dynamic
;
;pm.max_spare_servers = 35
 
; How much requests each process should execute before respawn.
; Useful to work around memory leaks in 3rd party libraries.
; For endless request processing please specify 0
; Equivalent to PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS
; default : 0
;
;pm.max_requests = 500

; Sets the status URI to call to obtain php5-fpm status page.
; If not set, no URI will be recognized as a status page.
; By default, it returns text/plain looking like:
; accepted conn:   12073
; pool:             www
; process manager:  static
; idle processes:   35
; active processes: 65
; total processes:  100
; "accepted conn" : the number of request accepted by the pool
; "pool" : the name of the pool
; "process manager": static or dynamic
; "idle processes": the number of idle processes
; "active processes": the number of active processes
; "total processes": idle + active
; The last three number are uptaded every second.
; The "accepted conn" is updated in real time
; *** Output ***
; By default it returns text/plain
; But passing as a query string html or json, it will returns
; the corresponding output syntax:
; http://www.foo.bar/status
; http://www.foo.bar/status?json
; http://www.foo.bar/status?html
; *** WARNING ***
; It has to start with a /. It could be named has you want.
; It's maybe not a good idea to use .php extension to be certain
; not to conflict with a real PHP file
;
; default: not set 
;
;pm.status_path = /status
 
; Set the ping URI to call the monitoring page of php5-fpm
; If not set, no URI will be recognized as a ping page.
; This could be used to test from outside that php5-fpm
; is alive and responding:
; - have a graph of php5-fpm availability (rrd or such)
; - remove a server from a pool if it's not responding (load balancing systems)
; - trigger alerts for the operating team (24/7)
; *** WARNING ***
; It has to start with a /. It could be named has you want.

; The timeout (in seconds) for serving a single request after which the worker process will be terminated

; Chroot to this directory at the start, absolute path
; *** WARNING ***
; chrooting is a great security features and should be used whenever it's possible.

; When not set, chroot is not used

; Additional php.ini defines, specific to this pool of workers.
; These settings overwrite the values previously defined in the php.ini.
; The directives are the same as the php sapi:
; - php_value/php_flag: you can set classic ini defines which can be overwriten from PHP call 'ini_set'. 
; - php_admin_value/php_admin_flag: those directives won't be overwriten by PHP call 'ini_set'
; For php_*flag, valid values are on, off, 1, 0, true, false, yes or no
;
; Defining 'extension' will load the corresponding shared extension from extension_dir.
; Defining 'disable_functions' or 'disable_classes' won't overwrite previously defined
; php.ini value, but the new value will be append.
